## A. Lyrics popularity predictor

B. The idea behind this tool for songwriters is to predict whether their song will be among the popular or most listened ones. Using the data from most listened songs and by using an ML algorithm it will give an estimate on how popular this song will be.

C. There are several data sources that we consider using, some related to the lyrics data such as million-song-dataset 
https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation/api-reference/
http://millionsongdataset.com/musixmatch/
other related to song popularity such as spotify API
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
Challenges related to privacy issues will likely also arise during the process.

D. In order to understand words used in successful songs we might perform some sort of clustering to see the words groups. Natural language processing seems to be quite relevant technique in our case, as well as regression in order to predict the popularity of given song. During the project we might learn new and more relevant techniques which can be used so this stays as a big challenge for us

E. EDA performed via some interactive tool (HTML...), results of the analysis might for example show similarities with other songs interactively

F. For a songwriter it might be useful to know the current trends in music in order to tuneÂ his own lyrics. We are hoping for some user-friendly way how the results can be presented. 

Static or dynamic

clustering types of words in successful lyrics against unsuccessful lyrics?

- are they about love, friends, war, violence, family...?
